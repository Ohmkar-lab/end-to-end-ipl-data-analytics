# end-to-end-ipl-data-analytics
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline, starting from raw data cleaning using SQL, followed by feature engineering and analysis using Python, and finally data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and showcase practical skills in SQL, Python (Pandas & NumPy), and Data Visualization.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

SQL – Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation & feature engineering

NumPy – Numerical operations

Data Visualization

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Version Control

Git & GitHub


🧹 Data Cleaning (SQL)

Removed duplicates and null values

Standardized inconsistent values

Renamed and formatted columns

Applied aggregations and window functions

Ensured data integrity before exporting for Python analysis

⚙️ Feature Engineering (Python)

Performed feature engineering using Pandas and NumPy, including:

Creating derived columns

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Aggregations and grouping logic

Preparing data for visualization

📈 Data Visualization

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:

Distribution plots

Trend analysis

Comparative bar charts

Correlation and relationship plots

These visualizations help in understanding patterns, trends, and key insights from the data.

🔍 Key Insights

Identified important trends and patterns in the dataset

Compared metrics across different categories

Highlighted performance indicators using visual analysis

Converted raw data into actionable insights
